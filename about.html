        <p>The Garage Gym started out with the Gymgoer brothers building their own gym in their parents garage.
          Wanting to share their passion for health and fitness, but tired of the expensive amenities that came with commercial gyms they created The Garage Gym.
          The Garage Gym is a facility that offers a wide variety of training from Olympic lifting to group fitness classes.
          We have many on staff trainers and through the Fitness For You app you can find a coach for your specific needs.
          The Garage Gym was created to be a no nonsense place for you to meet your fitness goals.
